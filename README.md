# Distributed-Quantum-Communication-channel-via-Quantum-Teleportation
🚀 New Project Launch: Distributed Quantum Communication via Quantum Teleportation using MBQT | Python + Qiskit 🧪💻

I'm excited to share my latest project that combines quantum computing and secure communication through a Measurement-Based Quantum Teleportation (MBQT) protocol, developed using Python and Qiskit!

🔐 Why it matters:

 Quantum technologies are revolutionizing cryptographic systems by addressing key limitations in classical encryption. Protocols like QKD, BB84, and B91 enable secure key exchanges—but still face challenges like noise, errors, and distance limitations.

✨ Our solution:

 This project proposes an enhanced MBQT framework with: 

 ✅ Automated noise detection

 ✅ Dynamic self-correction & retry mechanism

 ✅ Z-axis interference detection with threshold γ = -0.5

 ✅ Up to 5 retries for stabilizing quantum states

 ✅ Real-time secure messaging via a Flask-SocketIO-based chat app

🌀 Quantum states are encoded using Ry and Rz gates for teleportation, and fidelity is validated through Qiskit simulations—reaching up to 0.98 fidelity and 60% reduction in interference-based attacks.

🌐 This approach helps bridge theoretical quantum models with real-world scalable quantum communication systems, especially for NISQ devices.

💡 A step forward in building robust, long-distance, quantum-secure networks for tomorrow's digital infrastructure.

👉 I'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or ideas for collaboration!
